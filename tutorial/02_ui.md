# ADF Tutorial, Part 2: Creating The UI

The UI shall consist of a dialog for showing and finding employees based on: Jobs, Departments and free text search. 
The left pane should be an accordion with several tabs one for each type.
The center pane should be a filterable list which shall display a photo for each employee.
Finally a status pane on the right shall show contact details for selected employee.
The table shall have a toolbar to allow us to edit and create new users.

## 1.0 Creating the page.

Keyword   | Value
----------|------------------------------------------------------------------
Page type | Facelets
Page name | employees.jsf
Template  | Oracle Three column
Components| Accordion (three tabs: Departments, Jobs, Search)

### Instructions

* 1.1 Start by creating the base page for locating employees.
* 1.2 Next add the accordion to the left and add three panes to it:

### Questions:

1. How can we add things to the various panes in the accordion?
   Name atleast three ways
2. Whats the difference between a jsf and a jsff page?
3. How can we customize the template (for instance add a logo)

## 2.0 Add a tree for departments.

In the accordion on the left we want to be able to select employees based on jobs and departments.

Keyword   | Value
----------|------------------------------------
Components| Tree / ADF Tree
View      | DepartmentsView
Fields    | DepartmentName, FirstName, LastName

### Instructions

* 2.1 Add a "ADF Tree" based on the DepartmentsView object.
* 2.2 Show DepartmentName and FirstName + LastName attributes in the tree.

### Hints
 
* 2.1 Data Controls are found in a separate tab in the Application view.
* 2.1 Drag the data source to where on the page you want it.
* 2.2 Dont forget to add a second node to the TreeBinding (+)

## 3.0 Add a "ADF Tree" based on the AllJobsView object.

In the accordion on the left we want to be able to select employees based on jobs and departments.

Keyword   | Value
----------|------------------------------------
Components| Tree / ADF Tree
View      | AllJobsView
Fields    | JobTitle, FirstName, LastName

### Instructions

* 3.1 Add a "ADF Tree" based on the AllJobsView object.
* 3.2 Show JobTitle and FirstName + LastName attributes in the tree.

### Hints

* 3.1 See Task 2 above.

## 4.0 Add employee table.

We need a table where we can select employees for editing and viewing.
This goes in the central pane.

Keyword   | Value
----------|------------------------------------------
Components| Table / ADF Table
View      | EmployeesView
Fields    | Gravatar, FirstName, LastName, Email
Selection | Single row
Filtered  | Checked
Sortable  | Checked
Read-only | Checked

### Instructions

* 4.1 Add employee table.
* 4.2 Show only Gravatar, FirstName, LastName and Email.
* 4.3 Make sure we can select only single rows in the table.
* 4.4 Also enable sorting and filtering as well as make it a read-only table.

## 5.0 Add a "ADF Form" based on the EmployeesView object.

On the right pane we want a quick preview of the selected employee.

Keyword   | Value
----------|------------------------------------------------------
Fields    | Gravatar, FirstName, LastName, + All contanct details
Selection | Single row
Read-only | Checked

### Instructions

* 5.1 Show only Gravatar, FirstName, LastName and Email.
* 5.2 Make sure we can select only single rows in the table.
* 5.3 Also enable sorting and filtering as well as make it a read-only table.

## 6.0 Add logic to make this dialog work as expected.

This involves syncronizing the various iterators as well as setting up ppr to work correctly.

### Instructions

* 6.1 Make sure all views behave as expected. I.e. selecting a user in jobs/departments selectes the employee in the table and updates the preview form on the right.

### Hints

* 6.1 Edit the various trees and set the employee level "target data source" to point to the ${bindings.EmployeesViewIterator}
* 6.2 Make sure you setup the various employees objects (table/form) to listen to events from all trees (see PartialTrigger option)

## 7.0 Add ability to edit employees.

Keyword     | Value
------------|------------------------------------------------------
Task Flow   | edit-exmployees.xml
Flags       | Bounded, NOT fragments
Transaction | Begin new
Outcomes    | save (for commit) and cancel (for rollback)
View name   | edit.jsf

Since this is an administrative application we want tohave the ability to edit the employees. To best resolve this we want to create a flow for managing users. Initialy (in this iteration) we will create a flow for editing users. Later we will add the ability to add/delete users. Please note that we will need transactions for this so we can rollback any changes if we click cancel.

### Instructions

* 7.1 Create a bounded task flow based on JSF pages.
* 7.2 In the task flow add the edit page and make sure we can commit the transaction at the end.
* 7.3 Add a rollback option.
* 7.4 Add transaction support

### Hints

* 7.1 When you create the bounded task flow make sure you unselect "with Page framgnets".
* 7.2 Actions can be dragged from the data control
* 7.4 Set the "Always begin new" transaction flag on the "Overview _> Behavior" tab

## 8.0 Add edit button

Create routing between the two dialogs and add toolbar buttons to the employee table to allow editing the currently selected user.

### Instructions

* 8.1 Update the controller with routing between the page and the task flow we created before
* 8.2 Add a tool bar to the table
* 8.3 Add an edit button to the toolbar
* 8.4 Set the action for the button to initiate the task flow

### Hints:

* 8.1 The controller for our application is an unbounded taskflow. Which is where we need to add our routing.
* 8.2 Best way to add a toolbar is to right click the table and select "surround with".
* 8.3 The same strategy can be used to add the button but instead ad them inside the toolbar.
* 8.4 The action parameter is used to set the outcome of the button
* 8.4 With the routing corrrect we can "select" the action

## 9.0 Add edit employee form

Add a form which allows us to edit the current employee. The form should also have save/cancel buttons which connect to the task flow actions for the same. The view should use the same three pane template as before.
The content of the page should be a simple form and two buttons.

### Hints:

* Double click the view to create/edit it.
* Drag dataobject as before.
* Dont forget to remove the transient fileds (gravtar, etc)
* You can add commit/rollback buttons by clicking the "submit" option in the form dialog.
* Connect buttons with outcomes by setting the action on the button.
 
## 2.3 Add routing between views.

Keyword      | Value
-------------|------------------------------------------------------
Outcomes     | save (for commit) and cancel (for rollback)

The last thing we need to add before we can start using our form is routing between the forms. To do this we need to add routing rules between our views on the unbounded task flow which represents the controller and allows us to navigate between pages.

### Hints:

* The default unbounded taskflow is called adfc-config.xml
* Drag the employees view and the task flow (notice that the second view cannot be run independently) to this task flow.
* Dont forget to add a return action
* Since we already have commit and rollback we can rollback the global transaction (or commit it)

### Hints:
 * Why is the design of the commit/rollback we have bad?
 * What would be a better design?

## 2.4 Add routing between views.

Keyword      | Value
-------------|------------------------------------------------------
Components   | Panel Collection, Button
Action       | editEmployee
Title        | Edit

The last thing we shall do in this iteration is add the edit button to the emaployees view.

### Hints:

* Surround the table with a "Panel Collection"
* Add a toolbar with a button to the new toolbar facet.
* Set the outcome of the action to editEmployee
* Once you start to reorganize your form your partial triggers will show up as red. This is due to the ::: actually having a meaning and not beeing random.

### Questions:

1. What is the meaning of :: in the ids?

## 2.5 Test the flow

You should now have a working flow where you can go in an edit employees by running the employee.jsf file and then clicking edit.


## 3 Fixing the image.

Keyword      | Value
-------------|------------------------------------------------------
Small size   | 16px
Large Size   | 200px

The current page is not very pretty. For instance the gravatar is displayed as a "text string" the buttons have no icons, and so on and so forth. To remedy this we can clean up the pages a bit.

* Change the gravatar field in the table and form on the employees page to display the photo.
* The image in the table is to large. Make it smaller
* Image in form is to small, make it bigger

### Hints:

 * Use an image to display the image
 * Set the source to the el expression you used for output before.
 
### Questions:

 * Why is the one called row.Gravatar and the other bindings.Gravatar.inputValue
 * Why is your solution to shrinking the image worse than mine?

## 4 Add support for creating new employees.

We need the ability to create new employees as well as edit. To do this we need to change the task flow to "insert" a new user before we bring up the edit dialog.
We also need to add a "new" button as well as add a way to control the flow of our taskflow so we can either edit or create employees.

## 4.1 Change the task flow to support creating users.

Keyword      | Value
-------------|------------------------------------------------------
Parameter:   | action
Component:   | Router, createOrEdit
Component:   | CreateInsert
Expression:  | #{pageFlowScope.action == 'edit'}
Expression:  | #{pageFlowScope.action == 'create'}

Add a parameter (action) to the task flow. 
Then extend the flow with a routing component which routes based on the action to either "the old edit" flow.
Or a new createinsert method call.

### Hints:

* Add an argument (action) to the task flow.
* Add an inbound router which routes given the parameter
* Route the create leg to a "create new"
* The action parameter can be found in the #{pageFlowScope.action}
* The createInsert new operation can be dragged from the data control (use the correct view object)
* *DONT* forget to change the default activity to the router (I did).
* If you get "activity not found" verify that ALL required attributes have been set (for instance default outcome on the router)

### Questions:

* Why do we use the "strange" expression (and not: #{pageFlowScope.action} == 'edit'
* Why do we need the router and the parameter? (why not two starts?)

## 4.2 Add a managed bean to store the variable between two views.

Keyword      | Value
-------------|------------------------------------------------------
Parameter:   | action, java.lang.String, required
Values:      | create / edit
Managed bean:| EmployeeHelper, action, request scope
Bean class:  | name.medin.tutorial.adf.intro.view.EmployeeHelper

Adding a managed bean to the adf-config and set the value of this bean as the input parameter for the task flow.

### hints:

1. Adding a managed bean is done in the unbounded taskflow (adfc-config.xml)
2. Adding managed beans is a bit strange if you add them to the faces-config.xml file and then move them adfc-config.xml it works automagically) if not you have to create the class manually. (best option for the class is to check the git repo).
2. Add a single string parameter (action) and generate accessors.
3. Input parameters can be configure in the unbounded taskflow for the bounded task flow.
4. If you can not find the bean in the expression dialog you have not configured it

### Questions:

1. Why do we need a managed bean? (What other options do we have?)
2. Why do we use the request scope?

## 4.3 Add "new" button and connect them.

Keyword      | Value
-------------|------------------------------------------------------
Target:      | #{employeeHelper.action}
Value:       | create
Value:       | edit

Add the new button to employees.jsf and connect them two buttons to the bounded task flow.
Dont forget to change the value in our bean accordingly.

### Hints:

1. Add the new button like before (same action)
2. Change the value of the bean with an action listsner
3. The Set property action listsner is suitable for this

### Questions:

* Why dont we have to add "" around the create/edit values?
* How can we se the value in "runtime" if we want to debug the flow?
* What happens if we set the value to "foobar"?

## 5. Make the application awesome!

Things you can do:
* Add a view criteria to the list to quickly allow showing only managers
* Make the ability to filter the table based on the "folders" in the tree. I.e. selecting "hr" will only show people in the HR department.
* Extend the database with a longer field for the email address


The coolest application and the coolest idea will win yet another price!
